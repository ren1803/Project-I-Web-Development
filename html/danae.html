        <p>The theme of Danae, like many other characters in Greek mythology, has been treated by a large number of 
        painters, including Titian, in whose studio at least five versions were made between 1540 and 1570, 
        currently on display at the Museo del Prado,1 Apsley House,1 the Hermitage,2 the Museum of Capodimonte
        and the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Also the painter Gustav Klimt portrayed a Danae in 1907 that is
        currently preserved in the Würthle Gallery in Vienna.</p>
        <p>Danae represents a classical myth that inspired artists from every period. As told in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, 
        Danae was a princess of Argos, whose father, Acrisius, imprisoned her into a bronze tower to avoid her 
        from falling pregnant after an oracle had predicted his grandson would kill the king. Eventually, the
         king was responsible for his faith. The mystery created around Danae’s outstanding beauty and reclusion 
         appealed to Zeus who took the form of golden rain to meet with the young lady and seduce her. From this 
         relationship, their son, Perseus, was born. Feeling again the urge to act upon destiny, Acrisius set his 
         daughter and her newborn son into a chest to drift away at sea, but Zeus and his brother Poseidon ensured 
         the pair would reach the shore. When Perseus reached adulthood, he fulfilled the prophecy, killing his 
         grand-father without knowing as part of an Olympic dual.</p>
