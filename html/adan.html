        This picture, in a sense, depicts more than the creation of the first man, in fact, it shows the very start of what would later become 
        the human race. Adam's figure is curved as he stretches out to God, taking one's mind to the idea that man is made in the likeness of
        God himself. The way the two dominant figures relate and correspond to each other, one can almost see the closeness that Adam has
        with his creator. Michelangelo made the Creation of Adam in such a way that the figure of Adam echoes the figure of God, almost as 
        if one is nothing but an extension of the other.
        <p> God's form, in turn, is stretched out to reach Adam. However, God appears to be in some suspended imperceptible shape that houses 
            him and other angelic figures. The angels within Michelangelo's frame differ from the typical impression of angels in that they 
            do not have wings. These angels hold up the support that God is painted upon, and there appears to be some drapery whipping out 
            in their background. In this figure, God's form has been made clear, almost as if he were human. He is elderly, but even with
             his long grey hair and equally long beard, his body is masculine and somewhat youthful.</p><aside>
